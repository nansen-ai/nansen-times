One determined whale has been quietly building a position in HYDRA, an under-the-radar Ethereum token with a modest $604K market cap. The wallet has accumulated $50,968 worth of tokens over the past 30 days, including nearly $3K in fresh buying within the last 24 hours.

What makes this accumulation pattern particularly interesting is its consistency. The whale added $19,983 worth of HYDRA over the past week alone, suggesting a deliberate and sustained accumulation strategy rather than opportunistic buying. At 398 days old, HYDRA has flown under most traders' radars, but this smart money activity could signal hidden value.

With such a small market cap relative to the accumulation size, this whale now holds a significant portion of the token's supply. The sustained buying pressure over multiple timeframes indicates strong conviction in HYDRA's potential, making it a token worth monitoring for breakout potential.
