Smart money continues to show unwavering confidence in Uniswap's governance token, with UNI representing nearly 10% of total whale holdings at $221.8 million. The decentralized exchange token maintains its position as the top holding among 28 different smart money wallets, despite the broader market's rotation into newer narratives. At nearly 2,000 days old, UNI's staying power in whale portfolios underscores the enduring value of established DeFi infrastructure plays.
