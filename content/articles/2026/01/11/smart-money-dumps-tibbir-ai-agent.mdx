Smart money is sending a clear signal on Base's hottest AI agent play. Three whale wallets dumped $5,516 worth of TIBBIR tokens in the past 24 hours, marking the first significant outflow for the memecoin that had been riding high on AI agent narrative momentum.

The sell-off comes despite TIBBIR maintaining its massive $186 million market cap, making it one of the largest AI agent tokens in the ecosystem. The token had seen consistent inflows over the past month totaling $42,625, but yesterday's action suggests smart money may be taking profits or rotating into newer plays.

TIBBIR's classification in both the 'Memecoins' and 'AI Agents' sectors has made it a darling of narrative traders, but the whale behavior indicates potential caution ahead. With the token nearly a year old at 364 days, it may be losing its edge to fresher AI agent launches.

The timing is particularly notable as Base continues to dominate the AI agent token landscape, but smart money appears increasingly selective about which projects deserve sustained accumulation.
