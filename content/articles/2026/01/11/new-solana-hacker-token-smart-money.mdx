The Solana memecoin factory is churning out winners, and smart money isn't waiting around. 🌱 HACKER, launched just 2 days ago, has already caught the attention of whale wallets with $2,765 in fresh accumulation over the past 24 hours.

Despite its infancy, HACKER has managed to achieve a respectable $1.25 million market cap, suggesting strong retail interest backing the smart money play. The token's rapid rise and immediate whale attention indicates it may have the viral potential that has made Solana memecoins legendary.

With pump.fun continuing to mint millionaires overnight, early smart money positioning in tokens like HACKER represents the new meta. The whale's timing - getting in during the first 48 hours - could prove prescient if HACKER follows the trajectory of other successful Solana launches.
