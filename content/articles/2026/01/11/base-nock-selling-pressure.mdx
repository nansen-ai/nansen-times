Base-native token NOCK is facing sustained smart money distribution, with $17,911 in net outflows over the past month and $8,451 in selling pressure over the past week alone. The 23-day-old token, despite maintaining a $67.7 million market cap, appears to be losing favor among whale wallets. Yesterday's $2,601 outflow continues the trend, suggesting smart money may be rotating into fresher Base opportunities or taking profits after NOCK's initial run-up.
