The AI token AGI experienced $1,592 in smart money outflows over 24 hours, adding to concerns about whale confidence in artificial intelligence plays despite the sector's mainstream popularity. With a $46.3 million market cap spanning AI Agents, Artificial Intelligence, and Metaverse sectors, AGI's inability to retain smart money suggests sophisticated traders are skeptical of current AI token valuations. The selloff contrasts sharply with retail enthusiasm for AI narratives, highlighting a potential disconnect between informed money and retail sentiment in the space.
