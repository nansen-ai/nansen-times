Smart money is making swift exits from established crypto infrastructure tokens, with MYST leading the charge as whales dumped $14,093 worth of the VPN protocol token in the past 24 hours. The selloff represents the largest single outflow tracked by Nansen's smart money wallets, sending ripples through the crypto payments sector.

MYST, the native token of the Mysterium Network's decentralized VPN service, has been a darling of privacy-focused investors since its inception over 5 years ago. However, the sudden exodus suggests institutional players are repositioning their portfolios as the market enters a new phase. The $4.43 million market cap token now faces pressure as whale wallets that previously accumulated during bear market lows begin taking profits.

The selloff extends beyond MYST, with SubQuery (SQT) experiencing $12,443 in outflows from three separate smart money traders, indicating broader skepticism around scaling infrastructure plays. Meanwhile, Base-chain tokens WIRE and NOCK also saw significant exits, with $4,195 and $1,822 in outflows respectively, suggesting smart money is rotating away from newer chain ecosystems.

This coordinated movement by sophisticated traders often precedes broader market shifts, making it a crucial signal for retail investors to monitor. The question now is whether these whales are simply profit-taking or positioning for a deeper correction in infrastructure tokens.
