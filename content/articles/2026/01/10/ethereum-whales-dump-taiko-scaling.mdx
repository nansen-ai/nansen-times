Ethereum's scaling narrative is losing steam with smart money, as evidenced by a notable $6,132 outflow from TAIKO in the past 24 hours. The selling comes from a single whale wallet that appears to be rotating out of the 625-day-old scaling solution despite its $37 million market cap.

TAIKO's classification in the 'Scaling & Connectivity' sector made it a favorite during the layer-2 summer, but the recent smart money exodus suggests institutional appetite for scaling plays may be waning. The timing coincides with increased competition in the Ethereum scaling space and potential shifts in investor focus toward other narratives.

While $6,132 represents a relatively modest outflow, the fact that it comes from sophisticated wallets tracked by Nansen indicates this could be an early signal of broader rotation away from scaling tokens toward other emerging sectors like AI agents and RWAs.
