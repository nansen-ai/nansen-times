Smart money is fleeing WIRE token on Base, with sophisticated traders dumping $32,456 worth of the token over the past seven days. The exodus intensified in the last 24 hours alone, with $11,784 flowing out as whale confidence appears to crumble in the year-old project.

The sustained selling pressure from just one major trader suggests institutional knowledge of potential headwinds for WIRE, which maintains a $3.7 million market cap despite the smart money retreat. The token, now 378 days old, has seen no buying interest from tracked whale wallets to offset the consistent dumping pattern.

This dramatic outflow stands in stark contrast to the broader Base ecosystem, where smart money is actively accumulating other tokens like TIBBIR. The selective nature of this selling suggests WIRE may be facing fundamental challenges that haven't yet reached retail investors.
