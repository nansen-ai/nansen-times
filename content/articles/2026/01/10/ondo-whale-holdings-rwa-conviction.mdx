Real World Assets continue to dominate institutional crypto portfolios, with ONDO holding the third-largest position among tracked smart money wallets at $184.4 million across 17 holders. The massive allocation represents 8.2% of total tracked holdings, demonstrating sustained whale conviction in the RWA narrative despite the token's 1,353-day age and established $1.26 billion market cap.
