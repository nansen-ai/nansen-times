The AI agent narrative is attracting serious money, with TIBBIR emerging as the clear favorite among sophisticated traders on Base. Three separate whale wallets have accumulated $44,151 worth of the token over the past month, with buying activity accelerating recently.

TIBBIR sits at the intersection of two of crypto's hottest sectors - memecoins and AI agents - commanding a $191 million market cap despite being nearly a year old. The sustained accumulation pattern suggests smart money believes the AI agent theme has significant runway ahead, particularly as the token combines viral memecoin mechanics with emerging AI utility.

The multi-wallet accumulation pattern indicates broader institutional interest rather than a single large buyer, lending credence to the thesis that AI agent tokens are entering a new phase of mainstream adoption among sophisticated crypto investors.
