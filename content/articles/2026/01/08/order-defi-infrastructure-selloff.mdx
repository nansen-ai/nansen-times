Smart money continues its retreat from DeFi infrastructure plays, with two traders dumping $26,320 worth of ORDER tokens over the past 24 hours. The decentralized exchange and oracle project, despite its 520-day operational history and $35.7 million market cap, couldn't retain sophisticated capital as traders rotate toward AI and gaming narratives. ORDER joins 1INCH in facing smart money selling pressure, suggesting broader skepticism about traditional DeFi scaling solutions in the current market cycle.
