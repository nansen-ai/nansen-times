The smart money hierarchy remains dominated by battle-tested Ethereum protocols, with Uniswap's UNI token commanding $223 million across 28 whale wallets, representing nearly 10% of all tracked smart money holdings. ONDO's impressive $188 million allocation across 17 holders confirms that Real World Assets have graduated from experimental narrative to institutional-grade investment thesis. The concentration of wealth in these established protocols, including $96 million in AAVE and significant positions in WLD and BGB, suggests smart money continues to prioritize proven utility over speculative newer plays for their largest allocations.
