Smart money is making a contrarian bet on TIBBIR, with four sophisticated traders accumulating $9,183 worth of the AI agent memecoin over the past 24 hours, even as the token posted a $13,138 weekly decline. The buying activity on Base chain suggests institutional players are viewing recent weakness as a buying opportunity in the red-hot AI agents sector.

TIBBIR, which sits at a $173 million market cap, represents the intersection of two powerful crypto narratives: memecoins and AI agents. The token's 361-day track record gives it veteran status in the rapidly evolving AI agent landscape, where newer projects often struggle to maintain momentum. The smart money accumulation pattern shows confidence in the project's long-term prospects despite short-term volatility.

The coordinated buying from multiple smart money wallets indicates institutional-level interest rather than retail speculation. With the AI agent sector continuing to attract venture capital and developer attention, these traders appear to be positioning for the next wave of adoption. The Base chain deployment also provides access to Coinbase's growing ecosystem, potentially expanding the token's reach to mainstream crypto users.
