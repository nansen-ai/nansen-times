Smart money is making a contrarian play on TIBBIR, with four sophisticated traders accumulating $9,181 worth of the AI agent memecoin over the past 24 hours. This buying spree comes despite the token suffering a $13,139 outflow over the past week, suggesting these whales see current prices as an attractive entry point.

TIBBIR, which sits at the intersection of the booming AI agents and memecoins sectors, has maintained a substantial $173 million market cap after 361 days of trading on Base. The token's dual classification positions it perfectly to capitalize on both the AI narrative and meme culture that continues to drive crypto speculation.

The coordinated accumulation by multiple smart money wallets indicates potential insider knowledge or technical analysis suggesting a reversal is imminent. With the AI agent sector experiencing explosive growth and memecoins maintaining their cultural relevance, TIBBIR's unique positioning could make it a prime candidate for the next major rally.
