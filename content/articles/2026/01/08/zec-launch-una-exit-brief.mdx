The speed of smart money in crypto continues to amaze, with brand-new Solana token 🌱 ZEC attracting $2,885 in whale buying on its very first day of existence. Meanwhile, the established GameFi and NFT token UNA is experiencing the opposite fate, with a smart money whale dumping $8,978 worth of tokens on Base chain. This pattern reflects the ongoing rotation from older GameFi plays toward newer, more speculative opportunities as traders hunt for the next big narrative in an increasingly crowded market.
