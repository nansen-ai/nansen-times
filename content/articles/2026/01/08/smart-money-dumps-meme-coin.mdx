The smart money is running for the exits, and retail traders may want to take note.

According to Nansen's wallet tracking data, at least seven wallets classified as "Smart Money" have liquidated their entire positions in a popular Solana-based token over the past six hours. The cumulative value of these sales exceeds $50 million.

What makes this particularly concerning is the timing. These wallets, which have a historical track record of entering and exiting positions ahead of major price movements, began their selling almost simultaneously at 6:00 AM UTC.

"When you see this level of coordination among sophisticated actors, it's rarely coincidental," noted our analysis team. "These wallets don't move together by accident."

The token in question had seen a 400% run-up over the past week, driven largely by social media hype and influencer promotion. Whether the smart money knows something the rest of the market doesn't remains to be seen.
