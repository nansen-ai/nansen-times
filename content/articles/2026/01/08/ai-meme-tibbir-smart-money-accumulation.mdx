The intersection of AI agents and memecoins is attracting serious smart money attention, with TIBBIR leading the charge as four separate whale wallets accumulated $19,455 worth of tokens over the past day. The Base chain token, which sits at a hefty $188 million market cap, represents the growing sophistication in the memecoin space.

TIBBIR's 30-day performance shows consistent smart money interest with $33,266 in net inflows, despite a temporary dip last week. The token's nearly year-long track record (361 days) gives it veteran status in the notoriously volatile memecoin sector, while its AI agent functionality adds legitimate utility beyond pure speculation.

The Base chain continues to emerge as a hotbed for innovative token experiments, with TIBBIR serving as a prime example of how memecoins are evolving beyond simple community tokens. Smart money's coordinated accumulation suggests these traders see significant upside potential in the AI agent narrative, particularly as the technology becomes more mainstream in crypto applications.
