The smart money is placing its bets on AI infrastructure—and GRASS is their horse.

Nansen data reveals that sophisticated wallets have accumulated over $45,000 worth of GRASS tokens in the past 24 hours alone, with 7-day inflows exceeding $225,000. The Solana-based token, which operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence, data oracles, and network scaling, appears to be a quiet favorite among funds and smart traders.

With a market cap hovering around $148 million, GRASS represents a mid-cap play in the increasingly crowded AI token space. But unlike many of its competitors, it's attracting genuine institutional interest rather than just retail speculation.

"The AI narrative isn't going anywhere," observed one portfolio manager tracking smart money flows. "But the question is which tokens have real utility versus pure hype. Smart money seems to think GRASS falls into the former category."

The token's classification across multiple sectors—Artificial Intelligence, Scaling & Connectivity, and Data Source and Oracle—suggests a diversified use case that may be driving this institutional confidence.
