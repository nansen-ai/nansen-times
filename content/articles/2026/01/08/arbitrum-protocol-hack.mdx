Another day, another DeFi exploit—but this one was particularly elegant in its execution.

At approximately 6:00 AM UTC, an unknown attacker executed a complex flash loan attack against a lending protocol on Arbitrum, draining approximately $12 million in various tokens. The attack exploited a known vulnerability in the protocol's price oracle mechanism.

Nansen's real-time monitoring detected the attack within minutes, tracking the stolen funds as they were rapidly swapped through multiple DEXs and partially bridged to other chains.

"This was textbook oracle manipulation," said a security researcher who analyzed the transaction. "The attacker borrowed a massive amount via flash loan, manipulated the price feed, and exploited the arbitrage opportunity—all in a single transaction."

The protocol team has paused all contracts and is working with security firms to assess the damage. Users with funds in the protocol are advised to check their positions immediately.

As always, The Nansen Times reminds readers: only risk what you can afford to lose, and always verify contract audits before depositing.
