UNI continues to dominate smart money portfolios with $226.9 million in holdings across 28 sophisticated traders, cementing its position as the most trusted DEX token among whales. Despite the broader selloff in DEX tokens like ORDER and 1INCH, UNI's massive $3.53 billion market cap and 1,942-day track record keeps it firmly entrenched as the blue-chip choice for decentralized exchange exposure.
