Uniswap's UNI token commands the largest allocation in smart money portfolios, with $226 million held across 28 sophisticated wallets representing 9.7% of total holdings. The decentralized exchange giant leads a diverse portfolio that includes $198 million in BGB exchange tokens, $190 million in ONDO real-world assets, and $115 million in Worldcoin's WLD. The concentration in established DeFi protocols like UNI and AAVE ($96 million) suggests smart money maintains conviction in proven crypto infrastructure despite recent rotations into AI and gaming sectors.
