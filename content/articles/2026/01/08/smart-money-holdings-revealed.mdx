Want to know where the smartest money in crypto has parked its capital? The Nansen Times has the exclusive breakdown.

At the top of the heap sits Uniswap's UNI token, commanding a staggering $231 million in smart money holdings across 28 whale wallets. That's nearly 10% share of holdings among tracked sophisticated investors—a remarkable concentration bet on the leading DEX.

The runner-up may surprise you: Bitget's BGB token holds $197 million across just 5 wallets, suggesting massive conviction from a small number of very large players. ONDO, the RWA darling, follows with $191 million spread across 17 wallets.

But perhaps most interesting is the $115 million position in Worldcoin's WLD token, held by 19 smart money wallets. Despite the controversy surrounding Sam Altman's iris-scanning project, institutional money appears unfazed.

Rounding out the top 5 is AAVE at $96 million—a testament to continued faith in DeFi lending protocols even as yields compress.

Notable mention: WLFI (World Liberty Financial) shows $42 million held by a single whale. One wallet, $42 million conviction. Now that's what we call diamond hands.
