A coordinated exodus from decentralized exchange tokens is underway, with smart money traders dumping a combined $41,714 worth of ORDER and 1INCH tokens in the past 24 hours. The selloff affects two major players in the Ethereum DEX ecosystem, suggesting broader concerns about the sector's near-term prospects.

ORDER suffered the heaviest damage with $26,320 in outflows from two smart money wallets, while 1INCH saw $15,394 in selling pressure. Both tokens operate in the decentralized exchanges and scaling connectivity sectors, indicating this may be a targeted retreat from DEX infrastructure plays rather than random profit-taking.

The timing of this dual selloff is particularly significant given the maturity of both projects - ORDER has been trading for 520 days while 1INCH has been active for over 1,842 days. With ORDER maintaining a $35.9 million market cap and 1INCH holding $215.6 million, these aren't speculative micro-caps but established DeFi infrastructure tokens, making the coordinated exit all the more concerning for the DEX sector.
