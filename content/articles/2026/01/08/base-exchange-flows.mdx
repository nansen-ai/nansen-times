The great migration from centralized exchanges continues, and Base network is emerging as a primary beneficiary.

Over the past 24 hours, Nansen has tracked more than $2.3 billion in outflows from major centralized exchanges, with a significant portion of these funds bridging directly to Coinbase's Layer 2 network, Base.

The trend reflects growing unease among crypto holders following a series of exchange-related controversies over the past year. "People are finally taking self-custody seriously," observed one DeFi researcher. "And they're choosing Base because of its low fees and Coinbase's backing."

On-chain data shows that much of the withdrawn capital is being deployed into DeFi protocols on Base, rather than sitting idle in wallets. This suggests a broader shift in how users interact with their crypto—not just holding, but actively putting it to work.

The implications for centralized exchanges could be significant if this trend continues.
